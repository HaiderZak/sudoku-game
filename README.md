``` 
- SELECT a cell, CHOOSE a digit between 1 - 9, press ENTER,
and the program will accept it (green) if the number does not exist in its row and column. Otherwise, 
it will appear red and you will be denied. 

- press SPACE to solve sudoku at any point in the game.

- press BACKSPACE to remove a non-initial cell.
